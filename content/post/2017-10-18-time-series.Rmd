Time Series are similar to Scatter Plots in that they have a line, but they do not have points. Below we will display Babe Ruth's homerun total trends over the years.

```{r}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
query<-"SELECT yearID,HR
FROM Batting
WHERE playerID='ruthba01'"

result<-sqldf(query)

ggplot()+
  geom_line(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR),color="green")+
  ggtitle("Ruth's Homerun Totals Throughout the Year")+
  xlab("Year")+
  ylab("Homeruns")
```
